Data Wrangling : Retail store analysis on black Friday using R

This project is about a retail store on Black Friday, the goal is to analyze and find trends to the data and this by using R.

The project is divided into 3 sections: 

1- Univariate data analysis: this section consists of the analysis of individual variables: discrete and continuous,  and understand the general structure of the data set and its variables. Visual representations using R libraries are used all along.

2- Bivariate data analysis: this section is related to the first one, I looked for relationships between pairs of variables, using the first part and some good sense, logic, and research about the retail field. 
The visual representations used are for bivariate variables, and depends on the variable type.

3- Multivariate data analysis: in this section I went deeper into the analysis , I took more than 2 variables and tried to find any relationships using different visualizations technique and including colors and shapes to help. 

I finished the project  by creating a linear model, and calculated the R_squared, and found that this model can be used to predict the amount spent by the customers. 

A summary at the end explained all the findings from the 3 analysis.
